Participant:
- Ian Kazembe

Summary:
- Challenge:
  Working alone, the biggest challenge was managing all aspects of the project, from setup to planning and implementation, without the benefit of group brainstorming or task sharing.
- Success:
  I successfully set up the Next.js project, pushed it to GitHub, havenâ€™t deployed it to Vercel yet, and created the initial navigation and placeholder pages. The project board was organized with user stories and tasks to keep me on track.
- Insight:
  I learned the importance of self-organization and using tools like the GitHub Project Board to break down the project into manageable steps. This helped me maintain focus and make steady progress.

Decisions Made:
- Use Next.js with TypeScript and ESLint.
- Add Tailwind CSS later if needed.
- Organize tasks and user stories on the GitHub Project Board.
- Set personal deadlines for each feature.

Next Steps / Assignments:
- Continue building out the main features (seller profiles, product listings, reviews, authentication).
- Review accessibility and SEO requirements.
- Update the board with progress after each work session.
